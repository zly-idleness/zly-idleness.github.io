# About Me

Hello, I'm Luoyuan Zhang, an enthusiastic computer science undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), set to graduate in 2026. My academic journey is fueled by a deep passion for technology and a relentless drive to explore the frontiers of computer science.My research interest is anchored in the nexus of Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) and efficient vision Large Language Models (LLMs). I am passionate about optimizing the synergy between hardware and software to enhance AI performance, focusing on developing systems that are both high-performing and resource-efficient. My goal is to advance LLMs in computer vision, creating models that offer deep understanding and swift processing of visual data, thereby pushing the boundaries of AI efficiency and capability.
