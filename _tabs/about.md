# 你好

I'm **Luoyuan Zhang** , an enthusiastic computer science undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), set to graduate in 2026. My academic journey is fueled by a deep passion for technology and a relentless drive to explore the frontiers of computer science.My recent research interest is anchored in the nexus of ** Machine Learning Systems (MLSys)** and **efficient vision Large Language Models ** . I am passionate about optimizing the synergy between hardware and software to enhance AI performance, focusing on developing systems that are both high-performing and resource-efficient. I find it interesting to advance multi-modal LLM, creating models that offer deep understanding and  and swift processing of data across various modalities, thereby pushing the boundaries of AI efficiency and capability.
